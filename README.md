# AI-Based Predictive Thermal & Load Management for Edge Computing

## Overview

This project presents an AI-driven system that predicts CPU temperature **10 seconds in advance** using a lightweight stacked LSTM model.
Unlike traditional reactive systems, it enables **proactive workload throttling before thermal thresholds are breached**, preventing performance drops and hardware stress.

---

## Why This Matters

Edge devices (IoT, Raspberry Pi, embedded AI systems) lack active cooling.
Reactive thermal management acts **too late**, after overheating occurs.

This project solves that by **predicting and preventing overheating**, improving system reliability and lifespan.

## Key Results

| Metric              | Proactive (Ours) | Reactive Baseline |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Time above 80°C     | 212 s            | 584 s             |
| Time above 75°C     | 513 s            | 1365 s            |
| Peak Temperature    | 82.8°C           | 84.6°C            |
| Temp Prediction MAE | 2.57°C           | —                 |
| Model Size          | ~120 KB          | —                 |

**✔ Achieved 63.7% reduction in time above 80°C**

## How It Works

* **Phase 1:** Simulate edge device sensor data using thermal RC model + Markov workload states
* **Phase 2:** Train stacked LSTM using 30-second history to predict temperature & load 10 seconds ahead
* **Phase 3:** Proactive controller uses predictions to prevent overheating and compares against reactive baseline

## Controller Logic

| Predicted Temperature | Action                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| < 70°C                | No action                 |
| 70–75°C               | Soft throttle (−25% load) |
| > 75°C                | Hard throttle (−50% load) |

Reactive baseline triggers only when **actual temperature reaches 80°C**.
